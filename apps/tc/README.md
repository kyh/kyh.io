The term <strong>Total Compensation</strong> captures all the different ways you are financially compensated by your employer: base salary, bonus, equity, benefits, etc.

This calculator normalizes all these different forms of compensation into dollar values (from private or public companies) so you can estimate the final amount you are paid.
