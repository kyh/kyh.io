Hello, I'm Kaiyu Hsu. You can call me Kai since we're pretty much friends now.

I enjoy creating things for the internet. By day, I get to do that through
investing, advising, and building products you may not have heard of, yet.

My work has taken me from tiny two man startups, through acquisions, IPOs and beyond.

Along the way I've helped scale products from dozens to millions of users.
I've published research on growth and retention. I've helped prototype and built
frameworks used by entire engineering orgs.

Boyont that, I have a few side quests that fill up my time.

You can find them on the home page.

I also love learning about economics, psychology, and business.
You'll find me dabbling in open source, drawing things, building apps,
and designing games.

But honestly, I spend most of my days procrastinating.

Welcome to my corner of the web.
