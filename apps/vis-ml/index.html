          <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <p>
              I'm currently looking for a new job and after interviewing at a
              few places I finally got my first offer! Yay!
            </p>
            <p>
              But after looking at the salary, my first thought was
              <span class="italics">"Is this considered a good offer?"</span>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <p>
              It’s not easy to tell without a frame of reference. So I ask my
              friends who are in the same field and ended up with a few data
              points:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <p>
              We can see that there's a correlation between years of experience
              and how much a person is getting paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              One way to figure out whether the offer was good is to see if it's
              above or below the average for my years of experience
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="4">
            <p>
              How about we create a formula which looks at the average salary
              per year of experience?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="5">
            <p>Here's what our formula can look like:</p>
            <p>
              This is a simple predictive model that takes an
              <strong>input (years of experience)</strong>, does a
              <strong>calculation</strong> (multiplies it by the average salary
              per year of experience), and gives an
              <strong>output (predicted salary)</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="6">
            <p>
              Calculating the prediction is simple multiplication. But before
              that, we needed to think about the
              <strong class="highlight-weight">weight</strong> we’ll be
              multiplying by
            </p>
            <p>
              Here we started with an average, later we’ll look at better
              algorithms that can scale as we get more inputs and more
              complicated models
            </p>
            <p>
              Finding the <strong class="highlight-weight">weight</strong> is
              the “training” stage. So whenever you hear of someone “training”,
              it just means finding the weights we use to calculate the
              prediction
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="7">
            <p>
              Now, lets go back to our salary and see what we think we shouldve
              gotten paid. Let's say I have 4 years of experience, we can put
              this into our formula to check
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="8">
            <p>
              Hmm does that look right? Now I'm curious, is average really the
              best number to look at here? Let's plot out our data to find out
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="9">
            <p>And plot the prediction line</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="10">
            <p>
              This line doesn't look very accurate. But what does accuracy mean?
              One way of checking the how good of a job our model does is by
              measuring how "off" the predicted value is from true values
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="11">
            <p>
              Here we can see the actual price value, the predicted price value,
              and the difference between them
            </p>
            <p>
              We call this our <strong class="highlight-error">"Error"</strong>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="12">
            <p>
              Now that we defined our measuring stick for what makes a better
              model, let’s experiment with a couple more weight values and
              compare them with our average pick:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="13">
            <p>
              Oh there's one thing we never realized! When you start your first
              job, your salary actually goes from 0 (when you're in school) to
              the tens of thousands
            </p>
            <p>Let's add this into our model as well:</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="14">
            <p>
              In this context, we call it a
              <strong class="highlight-bias">“bias”</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="14">
            <p>
              Let's try manually “training” our regression model, minimize the
              error by tweaking the weight and bias dials:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="15">
            <p>
              Congratulations on manually training your first regression model!
            </p>
            <p>
              Next we can learn how machines do it with an algorithm called
              "Gradient Descent"
