// Written by Claude Code 2.1.289.
// Claude Code function hooks: the plugin API's TypeScript declarations.
//
// EARLY ACCESS: this surface may change between releases without notice.
// Written by the engine each time it loads a mod from a folder the person
// owns, beside that mod as .claude-plugin/types/claude-code/index.d.ts;
// written again after an update rather than edited. The first line names
// the Claude Code version that wrote it. TypeScript 5.4 or newer reads it.
// `claude plugin validate <dir>` is the other half: it reads a plugin's
// manifest and its hooks module's source the way the engine will and
// reports what the module hooks and calls and everything the engine would
// refuse, before any session loads it.
//
// What is here: the module a hooks module may import types from,
//   import type { Register, On, EngineInterface } from 'claude-code'
// (at run time the import is empty), and the globals a hooks module has:
// `h` and `Fragment` (what JSX compiles against), the JSX namespace, and
// the environment's web APIs (URL, TextEncoder, AbortController,
// crypto.subtle, ...). A hooks module runs in an environment of its own:
// no DOM, no Node. The module, and every file it imports from the plugin,
// is named .ts, .tsx, .jsx, .js, .mjs, .cjs, .mts or .cts (a file named
// otherwise is not loaded) and is an ES module whatever its suffix: there
// is no `require`. A file of the plugin is imported with an `import`
// declaration. A module holding `import()` does not load. The elements a
// render hook draws with (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, ...) are not globals:
// they come from the surface's table,
//   const { Box, Text } = $.ui.resolve(e)
//
// Also here: 'claude-code/testing', the kit a plugin's *.test.ts and
// *.test.tsx files import under `claude plugin test <dir>`, which runs each
// in an environment like the one a plugin's hooks run in (no fs, network or
// process), the plugin loaded from the folder by the engine's own host:
// `test(name, async ($, on) => { ... })`, where `$` is the engine's own
// and the hooks `on` registers sit beneath every plugin; with describe,
// expect, tier, and `mock`, whose clock, store and env answer those nouns
// beneath the plugins from memory. `$.ui.mount` draws a component through
// the plugin on the surface the test names (terminal, desktop, vscode or
// mobile: never assumed) and hands back the drawing to read and act on by
// key: find an element, press a Button, type into an Input, drive a
// `Client`'s module (keys, pointer, posts, its frame clock), each act typed
// by that surface's element table, so one test body run over several
// surfaces covers the mod's hooks and description on each. It exercises
// the mod (its hooks, the tree they return under each surface's rules, its
// `Client` modules), never a surface's paint (Ink's, the desktop page's):
//
//   test('notes add up on every surface that takes input', async $ => {
//     for (const surface of ['terminal', 'desktop'] as const) {
//       const ui = await $.ui.mount({ plugin: 'notes', surface, ...BAND })
//       await ui.input({ key: 'new', text: 'milk' })
//       expect((await ui.find({ key: 'count' }))?.text).toBe('1 note')
//       await ui.key({ key: 'down', in: 'list' })
//       await ui.unmount()
//     }
//     for (const surface of ['terminal', 'desktop', 'vscode', 'mobile'] as const) {
//       const ui = await $.ui.mount({ plugin: 'notes', surface, ...HINT })
//       expect(await ui.find({ type: 'Text', text: /notes/ })).toBeDefined()
//       await ui.press({ key: 'dismiss' })
//     }
//   })
//
// Typing a plugin against it:
//   export const register: Register = (on, options) => { ... }
// or, in a .js module,
//   /** @type {import('claude-code').Register} */
//   export const register = (on, options) => { ... }
//
// A tsconfig.json (or jsconfig.json) that fits a hooks module:
//   {
//     "compilerOptions": {
//       "target": "es2023", "lib": ["es2023"], "types": [],
//       "module": "esnext", "moduleResolution": "bundler",
//       "strict": true, "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
//       "noEmit": true, "skipLibCheck": true,
//       "jsx": "react", "jsxFactory": "h", "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
//     },
//     "include": [".claude-plugin/types", "hooks", "types", "tests"]
//   }
// ".claude-plugin/types" is where the engine lays this file (claude-code/)
// and, beside it, this build's built-in tools (claude-code-tools/), the MCP
// tools connected when the mod last reloaded (claude-code-mcp/) and one entry
// per plugin the mod's plugin.json lists under "dependencies" (that plugin's
// own contract): what it adds to `$` in engine.create, so a plugin you
// depend on is typed with nothing copied (the include above takes the whole
// folder). "hooks" is the plugin's hooks/ folder, "types" its own contract
// and "tests" its test files. `lib` names no DOM: the environment has
// none, and its `Text` would shadow the element. A mod with no tsconfig of
// its own has these options without writing them: the engine gives it a
// tsconfig.json that extends .claude-plugin/types/tsconfig.json, which
// carries them with that folder as the one type root.
//
// A plugin that adds a noun to `$` ships its own contract: a .d.ts its
// plugin.json names as "types", exporting the noun's types at its top level
// and declaring the noun on the engine's interface,
//   export type Topo = { ... }
//   declare module 'claude-code' {
//     interface EngineInterface { topo: Topo }
//   }
// with no import or reference, its exported names led by the noun's
// PascalCase name; the plugin's own hooks module imports them from it.
